log for self
- grep -q and -P options are returning different values
- apparently grep -r --include*.{cc,h} "hello" - searches current directory RECURSIVELY and displays any files contianing the string hello and display only .h and .cc files - This reads: search recursively (in all sub directories also) for all .cc OR .h files that contain "hello" at this . (current) directory
- using grep -r "[^\x00-\x7F]" $var outputs every line w those chars(ASCI?) in each passed in arg and seaches recursively in all subdirectories
  - doesnt ouput lines with only numbers
  
PIAZZA:
- [^\x01-\x7F]  to check for the presence of non-ASCII bytes - instead of 00
- UPE free tutoring every day in boelter 2763 - NEED TO GO !
- need grep -P to detect null bytes?
- cant use grep -r and -P at the same time :(
- made a file called utf containing utf chars and ascii
- made a file called utfonly only containing utf shit
  - using grep w and wo -r and -P still outputs the utf only lines
- need to make a file(S) contianing null byte and/or other shit too maybe
- got grep -r -P working together!
- when pass text(empty) and text~ (not empty) both if (grep..) return different things!?

- if grep .. -> output name of file
- dont need to test for null byte - piazza

- wooooo solved first two scripts - next two should be easy
- first script was just not of the second one
