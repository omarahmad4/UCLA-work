- background:
- levels of autonomy

- similar to what google probably already does with all the map data it collects
- Jim Barna, executive director of DriveOhio, an innovation and technology division within Ohio DOT. “So where you may have blind spots, like around a corner, on a crosswalk, or if you’re not recognizing that there’s a red light approaching, that signal will provide that information, in ample time for that driver to make a decision.”
- $40 million Smart City Challenge grant from the U.S. DOT.
- multiple locations
- 



- future: all must be smart and connected and eventually human control not even allowed like irobot
- need sensors on all roads
- MUCH less stopping
- green waves
- ai controlled
- slowly from smaller systems to larger
  - communities -> cities -> counties -> states -> nationwqide?
  - problems: US liberty based country - people might (WILL) resist giving up control
  - personally i doubt we will see the time when all control of vehicles is ceded
- will require huge databases (big data) and high capacity data connections w more reliability (5g, 6g, etc)
- start w glossary of terms
- V2X environment - vehicle to everything
  - billions of data points an hour
  - 10x a second?
- could help emergency services by telling(forcing?) drivers to move to the side
-



- "Autonomous driving can definitely be scary to some, but it’s hard to deny the benefits. We’d see decreased congestion, reduced emissions, more efficient parking, lower transportation costs for everyone as well as a reduction in the cost of new roads and infrastructure. It would also greatly improve the mobility of elderly and disabled people."
