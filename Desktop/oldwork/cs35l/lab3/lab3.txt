-a, --all  do not ignore entries starting with .
-A, --almost-all  do not list implied . and ..
-did step one and ran gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg 
coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig command which outputted:

 - WHY PROBLEMS OCCURRED?????????

2. opened file INSTALL and it contains instns to install
says to use command: ./configure && make && make install
command been running for about a minute now - outputted a lot of text- did not 
work - hundreds of permsission denied errors, no such file or directory errors, 
and at the end a few lines saying ERROR 1 and ERROR 2
 - think i as a user do not have correct permissions to install packages onto 
the servers - an admin would have to run the command
 
didn;t do step 2 right! use prefix below to install to custom directory
- use --prefix=[ABSOLUTE PATH] and run from inside coreutils into a seperate 
directory outside coreutils
first used ./configure 
--prefix=/u/ee/ugrad/farooq/Desktop/cs35l/lab3/coreinstall
/u/ee/ugrad/farooq/Desktop/cs35l/lab3/coreinstall- outputted pages of text 
again but with no error
then used the two make commands: make && make install
- outputted pages more of text still w no errors
- think coreutils is now installed on my user system

3. need to find out how to reproduce bug
ls -aA outputs no dot files - leading letter takes over then (left-most)
ls -Aa outputs dot files 
./src/ls -aA for buggy ls command or coreinstall/bin/ls
- when use ./src/ls -aA it outputs the . and .. files (buggy)
  - ./src/ls -Aa has the same output (correct) 
- when use ls -aA doesn't output those files - (works)

4.
PATCH =  https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?att=1;bug=30963;msg=10\
;filename=0001-ls-A-now-overrides-a.patch
- trying wget on the above url does not have the intended effect
- just copied and pasted contents instead through emacs
- tried patch coreinstall/bin/ls patch - output:
patching file coreinstall/bin/ls
Hunk #1 FAILED at 4.
1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file coreinstall/bin/ls.rej
patching file coreinstall/bin/ls
Hunk #1 FAILED at 1903.

patching file coreinstall/bin/ls
Hunk #1 FAILED at 575.
1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file coreinstall/bin/ls.rej
- removed all lines in ls.rej from patch and tried again - this time gave no 
errors but the bug is still there 
- when run command prompts with nex patch would create ls file which alread 
exists... Assumer -R?  - tried yes first now trying no - then asks apply 
anyway?  - no option makes it actually work
 
- back 2/2
- not sure what 'top level of your source tree' refers to in step 5
- did make command in coreutils folder - no noticable effect
- 

- reinstalling coreutils into coreinstallv2:

- 
./configure --prefix=/u/ee/ugrad/farooq/Desktop/cs35l/lab3/coreinstallv2 && 
make && make install
- ls -aA and ./ls -aA do not produce same output - reproduced the bug
- then did patch coreinstallv2/bin/ls patch  - 4 failures - saved rejects to 
coreinstall/bin/ls.rej
- did comm -23 --nocheck-order coreinstallv2/bin/ls patch > patchdiff
- patch coreinstallv2/bin/ls patchdiff outputted:

patch: **** malformed patch at line 57: diff --git a/tests/ls/a-option.sh 
b/tests/ls/a-option.sh
- ls still buggy
- got hunk failures out but cant get malformed line out
- started over w new fresh patch
- 

- piazza said use lnxsrv07
- 

- was doing wrong - trying to patch to the installed coreutils instead of the 
src
- reinstalled and started over
- did make and make instal
- applied patch and it ouputted:
patching file NEWS
Hunk #1 FAILED at 4.
1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file NEWS.rej

Hunk #1 succeeded at 1900 (offset -3 lines).

patching file tests/ls/a-option.sh
- ran make again and it outputted:

         You should only need it if you modified 'Makefile.am' or

         The 'automake' program is part of the GNU Automake package:

make: *** [Makefile:5997: Makefile.in] Error 127

from piazza:
autoreconf -f -i
then configure and make and make install again
- src ls works now - -aA and -Aa now both output correct ouptuts

- did make again and it tried to apply make into all subdirectories
it was not necessary - it outputted:
