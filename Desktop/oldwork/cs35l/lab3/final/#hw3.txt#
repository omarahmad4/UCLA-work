Q1: the patch improves performance as it removes an if statement
Q2: other commands that rely on ls can also improve their performance

Q3: it gives an indexerror - out of range - because its trying to access a line 
that does not exist - output:
[farooq@lnxsrv09 ~/Desktop/cs35l/lab3/hw]$ python randline.py -n 3 a
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "randline.py", line 70, in <module>
    main()
  File "randline.py", line 64, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/usr/local/cs/Python-2.7.15/lib/python2.7/random.py", line 277, in 
choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  # raises IndexError if seq is 
empty
IqqqqqndexError: list index out of range

aQ4:it outputs:

[farooq@lnxsrv09 ~/Desktop/cs35l/lab3/hw]$ python3 randline.py -n 3 test
  File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
- this is because randline.py uses automatic tuple unpacking which is supported 
in python2 but not in python3
