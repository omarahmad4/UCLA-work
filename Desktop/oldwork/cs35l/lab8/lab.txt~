Omar Ahmad lab8 log - BeagleBone lab

0. Initial Setup
   - went to saeedstudio's BeagleBone green wireless update page and downloaded the latest debian image with a gui
   - also downloaded an image writer to write the image to an sd card
   - formatted the sd and wrote the image to the sd card
   - turned on the board with the sd card inserted and let the board boot from the card
   - then changed one line in /dev/boot to make the sd overwrite the onboard emmc
   - restarted the board and allowed the writing process to take place whichh took about 10 minutes
   - then followed instructions detailed in an email from my TA on how to set up the inital network connection
     	  - used connmanctl terminal for this
   - updated the programs on the board using sudo apt-get install update
   - installed xauth and xvfb as well
   - installed firefox using sudo apt-get install firefox-esr-l10n-en-gb
   - installed xming on my computer as well

   - root@beaglebone:~# sudo passwd omaromaromar
   Enter new UNIX password:
   Retype new UNIX password:
   passwd: password updated successfully
   set passord to password

   - Server Side (all from lab ccle slides):
     - serving as a server for groupmates
     - ran ssh-keygen
     - useradd -d /home/test -m omar
     - passwd 'password'
     - cd /home/test
     - mkdir .ssh
     - chown -R omar .ssh
     - chmod 700 .shh


   - Client Side (all from lab ccle slides):
     - connecting to Eli's bone
     - ssh-keygen
     - ssh-copy-id -i elielieli9090@10.97.85.73
       - eli logged in with his password
     - ssh-add
       - didn't work initially - gave connection error
       - had to use echo `ssh-agent -s`
       - then ssh-add - worked great
     - ssh debian@10.97.85.73
       - logged in without passwd
     - ran xeyes - worked !
     - ran firefox - took a while 



all had same effect
   no port forwarding needed
