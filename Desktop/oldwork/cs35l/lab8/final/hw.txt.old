1. Yes the network is still secure - because everything sent over the network is encrypted. so anyone watching would only see encrypted bytes and would need the private key which they dont have to see the actual data
   (1) the network would likely still be secure but not nearly as secure. They still would not have the private key as it is independent of keystrokes but they might be able to find out the passphrase which reduces the security of the system
   (2)if they had access to the usb, they should be able to access the public and private keys rendering the system unsecure and allow them to decrypt any encrypted bytes.


2. the --verify option does not actually verify who made the file - it merely checks whether the file and the detached signatures match. if someone else obtained the public key, they use it as their own and gain access to the file

this can be addressed by entrusting a third party with my public key to keep track of the orign of the public key and who posts it. One such third party is certificate authority. This solution allows one to keep track of the author of the public key
