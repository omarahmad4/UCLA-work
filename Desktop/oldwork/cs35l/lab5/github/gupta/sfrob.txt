1. Time comparison between sfrob anf sfrobu:
   1.1 Trying it on the test data from assigmment 4:
       time printf '*~BO *{_CIA *hXE]D *LER #@_GZY #E\\OX #^BO #FKPS #NEM\4' | ./sfrob
       real   0m0.002s
       user   0m0.001s
       sys    0m0.000s
       time printf '*~BO *{_CIA *hXE]D *LER #@_GZY #E\\OX #^BO #FKPS #NEM\4' | ./sfrobu
       real   0m0.002s
       user   0m0.000s
       sys    0m0.002s       
       
       the time taken is negligible, and hence the difference is negligible. But here too,
       system time is evidently more in unbuffered.
   1.2 Trying it with the 5MB data from the previous problem:
       time ./sfrob < input.txt
       real   0m0.010s
       user   0m0.004s
       sys    0m0.003s

       time ./sfrobu < input.txt
       real   0m6.983s
       user   0m0.820s
       sys    0m6.158s

       time cat input.txt | ./sfrobu
       real   0m9.567s
       user   0m1.450s
       sys    0m8.168s

       Here, the differences start to get more obvious. Unbuffered is clearly not the way to do
       things at all. And it is visible that there is also a difference between using sfrobu with
       a regular file and without one (more system calls without the regular file), because 
       as specified in the spec, using the regular file means that we buffer at least the contents
       of the file.
