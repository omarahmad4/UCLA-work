FILES:
source.c - source code for beaglebone green wireless and a grove cape connected to a tempereature sensor
	 - ouputs the temperature in C or F every period seconds
	 - takes commands at the command line or while program is running
	 - can start and stop w START and STOP
	 - can log any line of text with LOG [line of text]
	 - can press button or use OFF to shutdown program

Makefile -- targets:
	 - default: builds lab4b from source.c with -lmraa -l -g -Wall -Wextra flags
	 - dist: creates tarball for submission with Makefile, README, and source.c
	 - clean: removes executable lab4b and tarball
	 - check: checks basic functionality of program
	   	  - was working but for some reason when my Makefile would call my test script test.sh it would output more than what my test script would output and so it has been commented out now that the program is confirmed to be working

README - this file - contains descriptions of all included files and sources used

test.sh - contains script to test lab4b executable
