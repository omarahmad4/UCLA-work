ext2_fs.h - header for ext2 filesystem structures 
README -- (this file) contains descriptions of files and sources used
Makefile -- targets:
	 - default: builds executable lab3a with flags -Wall and -Wextra
	 - dist: creates tarball as requested by professor in autogradable format containing all files discussed above
	 - clean: removes executable, and tarball


Sources:
- man pages for all functions used
       - examples found in man pages used as templates
- used previous cs35l and cs111 projects of mine to get basics
- sources given in spec http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~harryxu/courses/111/spring19/ProjectGuide/P3A.html
  - most importantly is the one describing the details of the ext2 file system: http://www.nongnu.org/ext2-doc/ext2.html#superblock
  - func to test if nth bit is 1: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8920840/a-function-to-check-if-the-nth-bit-is-set-in-a-byte


Problems:
- when printing time stamps in Inode Summary, printf would print the last char * variable even when all 3 timestamps were stored in different variables
  - this caused me to have to resort to a very ugly implementation using sprintf, strcat, and addition of indiviudal commas using strncat
