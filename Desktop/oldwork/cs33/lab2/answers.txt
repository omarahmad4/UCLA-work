1. The correct mathematical result was higher than most-positive-fixnum, the largest number that emacs can handle. 
so there was overflow which is undefined behavior which caused the incorrect result 
the imul instruction caused the problem. it is instruction number 54dfd8. it ran twice and the second instance is likely to have caused the overflow

2.
most-negative-fixnum is the most negative number emacs can handle - it is -2^61
in the emacs code 'most-negative-fixnum' is defined on line 3892 of data.c 

3.
multiplying most-positive-fixnum by itself 4 times causes an overflow which evaluates to 1

4.
this would not fix the overflow problem but it would lead to more consistent and predictable behavior
in the case of a positive overflow it would just return the value mod most-positive-fixnum
